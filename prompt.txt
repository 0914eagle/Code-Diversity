You will be given two codes written for a same problem.

Your task is to rate the similarity between two codes.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep these codes open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.
The output (score) should be integer.

Evaluation Criteria:

Plagiarism (1-5) - the collective quality of code similarity.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the two codes carefully and identify the main flow.
2. Compare between two codes. Check the similarity of these two codes.
3. Assign a score for plagiarism on a scale of 1 to 5.

5: Two codes are an exact copy code. 
It is copied line by line, with the code structure, logic, algorithms, comments, whitespaces, 
and all other elements being identical.
4: Minor trivial modifications have been made.
Changes may include variable names, literal values, comments, etc., but the overall code structure, 
logic, and algorithms remain the same.
3: While the core logic and algorithms are preserved, there are some simple control or data flow changes. For example, 
the type of loop (for, while, etc.) may have been changed, or the order of conditional statements may have been altered. 
However, the overall code meaning remain similar.
2: The core algorithm is maintained, 
but it has been substantially modified to the extent that it has low flow and logic similarity. 
Detailed elements such as comments have been extensively modified, and some code blocks may have been rearranged or removed.
1: It is an entirely different, where the logic have been completely changed with no similarity. 
Two code differ in all aspects, including code structure, control flow, and data representation methods 
even if both codes are solving the same problem.
